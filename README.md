# Ascending-Descending-Order-List-With-Nodes
This is a c project, in which the user inserts an amount of numbers(between 1-20) 
and the choose whether to see the ascending order or the descending order. 

The program solves the problem with the use of nodes and a list.

The program creates a list and a pool of nodes. The nodes have a pointer to the next node and the data inside them 
which are the numbers the user inserted.

The changes between the number of the list are not made by the changing the position of the inserted numbers but 
with the use of the ".Next" ListPointer.
